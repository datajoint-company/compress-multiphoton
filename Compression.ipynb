    "# Image compression for functional multiphoton imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiphoton images are *noisy*: the signal is dominated by the quantum noise arising from the limited number of photons detected by the photomultiplier tubes. The noise contributes to the high entropy of the images, making them difficult to compress *losslessly*. Our goal is to accurately encode the underlying biological signals, not the recorded noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to re-quantize the images through a grayscale transformation optimized for preserving the underlying signal while reducing the total number of grayscale levels. This results in a significant reduction of signal entropy. "

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For $\\beta < 1.0$, the effect of grayscale quantization can be approximated as an independent random variable distributed uniformly on the interval $\\left[-\\delta/2, +\\delta/2\\right]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the mean and the variance of the noise and quantization are $$\\mathop{\\mathbb E}[\\varepsilon + d] = 0$$ and $$\\mathop{\\mathbb E}\\left[(\\varepsilon + d)^2\\right] = \\mathop{\\mathbb E}\\left[\\varepsilon^2\\right] + \\mathop{\\mathbb E}\\left[d^2\\right] = \\sigma^2 + \\frac 1 6 \\delta^2 =  \\left(1 + \\frac 1 6 \\beta^2\\right) \\sigma^2$$\n",

    "This rate predicts the size of the images after efficient lossless compression in regions of bright fluorescence with no motion or activity. In regions with calcium activity or motion, the bit rate will be higher. In regions with no fluorescence (below the single-photon threshold), the bit rate will be lower. Therefore, it's reasonable to estimate a bit rate of about 2.5/bits per pixel.  Considering that most current systems store the data unpacked in 16-bit values, this will lead to 6.4:1 compression ratio in an effectively lossless scheme. Some formats pack 12-bit or 10-bit data, so the compression rate may be 4:1."
